## Native JS. Widgets

### Description

At the moment, the application represents a page with a button which, when clicked, opens a modal window that displays a random image with coffee. The image is requested from an [open third party API](https://coffee.alexflipnote.dev/)

Application architecture - MVC. CSS class naming methodology - [BEM](https://getbem.com/).

### Stack

- JS
- HTML
- CSS
- Webpack

### Scripts

`npm run watch` - development mode; the project will be built in the `dist` folder, where you need to open the `index.html` file
`npm run build` - product mode; the project will be built in the `dist` folder, where you need to open the `index.html` file

### Future plans

Add two more modal windows that will request data from other APIs.
